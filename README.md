## Abstract

In this research, we analyzed the efficiency of supervised machine learning algorithms on traffic prediction using the 'Traffic Prediction Dataset' as our primary dataset. We also explored the impact of weather data on traffic congestion prediction. Our study involved three main supervised machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classifier. We achieved notable improvements in classification accuracy by incorporating additional features derived from the date. However, our results, while promising, fell short of matching the outstanding accuracy reported in a referenced article.

## Introduction

Traffic congestion is a pervasive problem with significant impacts on various aspects of society, including economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and individual well-being. Predicting traffic conditions accurately is crucial for mitigating congestion-related issues and improving transportation management. Supervised machine learning offers a powerful approach for traffic prediction, leveraging historical data to make accurate forecasts. This introduction outlines the challenges posed by traffic congestion and the potential of supervised machine learning in addressing these challenges.

## Results

We evaluated the performance of supervised machine learning algorithms on traffic prediction using the 'Traffic Prediction Dataset.' Our results indicate varying levels of accuracy and computational efficiency among the algorithms tested. The Classification Tree algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy, followed by Support Vector Machine and Ensemble (RUSBoosted).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our research demonstrates the potential of supervised machine learning algorithms for traffic prediction tasks. While our results show promising accuracy levels, there are still challenges to overcome, such as the need for large and accurate datasets and the dynamic nature of traffic conditions. Careful consideration of the strengths and limitations of each algorithm is essential for effective implementation in real-world traffic management systems.
